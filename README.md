Abstract: *High-resolution wafer transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images are vital for nano-level analysis in semiconductor manufacturing. While super-resolution offers significant potential for obtaining high-resolution images, training models for wafer TEM images remains challenging because of the absence of paired low-resolution and high-resolution data and the presence of wafer-specific noise caused by unstable magnetic fields and scattered electrons.  Moreover, super-resolved images must exhibit well-defined edges because wafer analyses focus on boundary regions. These challenges have limited research on super-resolution for wafer TEM images, despite its importance. This study performs a comprehensive analysis of wafer TEM images based on three stages, essential for super-resolution modeling: ‘practical degradation’, ‘image enhancement’, and ‘super-resolution modeling.’ We evaluate all 48 possible combinations of representative methods from each stage, identifying ‘RealBESRGAN’–‘HighboostFiltering’–‘ESRGAN’ as the best-performing combination. In addition, we conduct a detailed analysis to evaluate the impact of practical degradation, image enhancement and super-resolution architectures on the overall performance of super-resolution modeling. Our findings highlight the significance in addressing wafer TEM-specific challenges and provide a strong foundation for advancing super-resolution modeling of wafer TEM images.*

Detailed Folder Information
 - lr_128: cropped images from high-resolution images
 - lr_bicubic_128: simply applying bicubic downsampling for high-resolution images
 - lr_test_degradation_type1: use different degraded low-resolution images such as BSRGAN or RealESRGAN (also image size 128x128)
 - lr_test_degradation_type2: use different degraded low-resolution images such as BSRGAN or RealESRGAN (also image size 128x128)
 - lr_test_degradation_type3: use different degraded low-resolution images such as BSRGAN or RealESRGAN (also image size 128x128)
 - lr_test_degradation_type4: use different degraded low-resolution images such as BSRGAN or RealESRGAN (also image size 128x128)

 All experiments are reported using lr_128
